*Forest wildfire simulation* writtent in NetLogo using agents as firefighters and firesearchers (UHK.cz student's project).

  * here is country with hills and trees.
  * trees are randomly set on fire and sometimes fire jumps from tree to tree.
  * agent searchers are coming from fire base station to search fires in a hills.
  * after spoting the fire, they return to base station and inform firefighter agent about tree position.
  * then firefighter agent is going to fire location to douse the fire and try to search other fires in his vision area.
  * after successfull work firefighter is returing to base station.

_Note:_
  1. Source code is in Czech language
  2. With NetLogo 4.1 you will be promted about incompatibility of extension palette. Just ignore it, in my test it worked well.
  3. And of course you will need NetLogo itself. Download it from [here](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml).
