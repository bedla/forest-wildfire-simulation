Forest wildfire simulation in NetLogo using agents as firefighters and firesearchers (my old school UHK.cz project).

  * here is country with hills and trees.
  * rees are randomly set on fire and sometimes fire jumps from tree to tree.
  * gents searchers are coming from fire base station to search fires in a hills.
  * fter spoting the fire, they return to base station and inform firefighter agent about tree position.
  * hen firefighter agent is going to fire location to douse the fire and try to search other fires in his vision area.
  * fter successfull work is returing to base station.
